# Statistics and machine learning: from undergraduate to research

This repository contains links to references (books, courses, etc) that are useful for learning in statistics and machine learning (as well as in some neighboring topics).
References for background materials such as linear algebra, calculus/analysis/measure theory, probability theory, etc, are usually not included.
The level of the references starts from advanced undergraduate stats/math/CS and in some cases goes up to the research level.
It is hoped that the list benefits students and lifelong learners.
The list is highly subjective and incomplete, reflecting my own preferences, interests and biases. For instance, there is an emphasis on theoretical materials. Several topics are omitted due to lack of expertise (e.g., causal inference, biostatistics, ...) cake.
Please feel free to contact me with suggestions.



# Statistics
## Principles
- [Casella & Berger, Statistical Inference (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126) - The best introduction to the principles of statistical inference at an advanced undergraduate level. Mathematically rigorous but not technical.
- [Cox: Principles of Statistical Inference](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Statistical-Inference-D-Cox/dp/0521685672) - Covers a number of classical principles and ideas such as pivotal inference, ancillarity, conditioning. Light on math, but containing deep thoughts.
