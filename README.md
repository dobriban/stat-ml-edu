# Statistics and machine learning: from undergraduate to research

This repository contains links to references (books, courses, etc) that are useful for learning statistics and machine learning (as well as some neighboring topics).
References for background materials such as linear algebra, calculus/analysis/measure theory, probability theory, etc, are usually not included.
The level of the references starts from advanced undergraduate stats/math/CS and in some cases goes up to the research level.
It is hoped that the list benefits students and lifelong learners.
The list is highly subjective and incomplete, reflecting my own preferences, interests and biases. For instance, there is an emphasis on theoretical materials. Several topics are omitted due to lack of expertise (e.g., causal inference, Bayesian statistics, functional data analysis, biostatistics, ...).
Please feel free to contact me with suggestions.



# Statistics
## Principles
- [Casella & Berger: Statistical Inference (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126) - The best introduction to the principles of statistical inference at an advanced undergraduate level. Mathematically rigorous but not technical.
- [Cox: Principles of Statistical Inference](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Statistical-Inference-D-Cox/dp/0521685672) - Covers a number of classical principles and ideas such as pivotal inference, ancillarity, conditioning. Light on math, but containing deep thoughts.


## Statistical Methodology
- [Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman: The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf) - The bible of modern statistical methodology, comprehensive coverage from linear methods to kernels, basis expansions, trees/forests, model selection, high-dimensional methods, etc. Emphasizes ideas over math. Free on author's website.

## Statistical Theory
### Core Theory: First Year PhD Curriculum
- [Lehmann & Casella: Theory of Point Estimation, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Point-Estimation-Springer-Statistics/dp/0387985026) - Solid mathematically rigoros overview of point estimation theory. Known as "TPE"
- [Lehmann & Casella: Testing Statistical Hypotheses, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Statistical-Hypotheses-Springer-Statistics-dp-3030705773/dp/3030705773) - A complement to TPE, covers the theory of inference (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals).
- [van der Vaart: Asymptotic Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Asymptotic-Statistics-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521784506) - Covers classical fixed-dimensional asymptotics.

### Advanced Theory
#### Non-parametrics
- [Tsybakov: Introduction to Nonparametric Estimation](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Nonparametric-Estimation-Springer-Statistics/dp/0387790519) - The first two chapters contain many core results and techniques in nonparametric estimation, including lower bounds.

#### Semiparametrics


# Machine Learning

## ML Theory
- [Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David: Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf) - Probably the best single source of core machine learning theory ideas and results/

# Optimization

- [Boyd and Vandenberghe: Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) - Good user and algorithm-focused book on convex optimization. Mathematically rigorous and clean, but does not go deep in the theory.
- [Nesterov: Introductory Lectures on Convex Optimization: A Basic Course](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Lectures-Convex-Optimization-Applied/dp/1402075537/) - A deep dive into convex optimization theory, including optimality results.
