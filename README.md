# Statistics and machine learning: from undergraduate to research

This repository contains links to references (books, courses, etc) that are useful for learning in statistics and machine learning (as well as in some neighboring topics).
References for background materials such as linear algebra, calculus/analysis/measure theory, probability theory, etc, are usually not included.
The level of the references starts from advanced undergraduate stats/math/CS and in some cases goes up to the research level.
It is hoped that the list benefits students and lifelong learners.
The list is highly incomplete and subjective, reflecting my own preferences, interests and biases. For instance, there is an emphasis on theoretical materials.
Please feel free to contact me with suggestions.
